<!-- Main  -->
- When the topic is changed, the number of rendered gifs should go back to the normal ( so reset the context whith the different topic )

- Maybe add 'onerror' to each gif image

- If a gif is clicked, it should display the options to "Download" and "Share" to any social network 

- I may use react Router to display the search more easily instead of forwarding refs

- Topics, rating, and cuantity to be global contexts

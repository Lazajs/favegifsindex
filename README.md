<!-- Header and more  -->
- The search form should be a single component so can be different from header.

- The search form should be a button in mobile, which will toggle onclick

- Maybe changing the header bg image to put a nice logo and delete that text



<!-- Main  -->
- When the topic is changed, the number of rendered gifs should go back to the normal ( so reset the context whith the different topic )

- If a gif is clicked, it should display the options to "Download" and "Share" to any social network 

- I may use react Router to display the search more easily instead of forwarding refs

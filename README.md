<!-- Header and more  -->
- create a context to know if the user is on mobile or desktop
- maybe agregar onerror a los gifs


<!-- Main  -->
- When the topic is changed, the number of rendered gifs should go back to the normal ( so reset the context whith the different topic )

- If a gif is clicked, it should display the options to "Download" and "Share" to any social network 

- I may use react Router to display the search more easily instead of forwarding refs

- Topics, rating, and cuantity to be global contexts

<!-- Loading  -->

- Change the name from "Charging" to "Loading" to the component

- Change the animation and put something more serious
